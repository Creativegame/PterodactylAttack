Vectors have to be handled differently on multiple platforms:
	- Webkit browsers prefer SVG
	- Firefox browsers prefer Paths, but result in slower performance
	- Cocoon prefers Paths

Change the colors of the pterodactyls is tricky.
	- We can generate .js files for the paths
	- We can either multiple the storage requirements by 12

Webkit:
	- generate the SVGs at build time

Firefox:
	- generate the JS paths 

Cocoon:
	- must dynamically generate the colors at runtime because
		- too many 'eval's breaks on iphone
		- loading too many generated JS paths crashes android
