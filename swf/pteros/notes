To take SVG frames from a SWF file....

1.

Go to Google Swiffy
https://www.google.com/doubleclick/studio/swiffy/

Upload the SWF file and save the page locally.

2.

Open the page in a text editor and remove the 'svg' element.

3.

Insert the text:
<script src="getSvgFrames.js"></script>

4.

Open the file and save all the frames from the auto-created download links.

5.

Edit each svg file:
	- move the width and height attribtues from the rectfill tag to the svg tag (append the numbers with "px")
	- remove the rectfill tag
	- remove the first g transform tag and its closing tag.
	- half each line width (cocoon doubles it for some reason)
