HTML5 standard has Path objects which are not supported by any browser at the moment.  But CocoonJS supports a subset of it.
	- This will split our codebase into Desktop/Mobile background drawing.
		- We can possibly just draw the SVG on most desktop browsers using drawImage.
		- The Path objects may prevent problems with video memory on mobile.

SVG paths cannot be used directly as a Path constructor argument but we can use these tools to convert them to canvas paths:
	- http://www.omnisoftsystems.com/?returnUrl=/iTrax/Home/svg2Canvas/0
	- http://www.professorcloud.com/svg-to-canvas/

	Both tools use canvg: http://code.google.com/p/canvg/

CocoonJS doesn't support:
	Path.createLinearGradient
		- work-around by drawing directly
	Path.globalAlpha
	normal alpha-blending with Path.fillStyle="rgba(...)"
		- work-around by drawing directly
